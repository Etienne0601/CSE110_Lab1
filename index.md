## Interests

I enjoy learning about a variety of subjects, here's a short subset of the interests and activities that I have and have not explored, in task list form:
- [X] Basic Electronics and Circuits
- [X] Basic Programming
- [X] Linux related projects, such as making my own backup server, for example
- [ ] Cryptography
- [ ] Amateur Radio and DIY Radio
- [ ] Understanding already written code and reverse engineering code
- [ ] Coding a Simple Multiplayer Game from start to finish

## Code Example

One day I woke up and learned to write this piece of code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
And then I said:
> Wow, what a neat piece of code!
